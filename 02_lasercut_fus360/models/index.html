<p>I made a few models of household objects. Two of them are a screw and a roll of paper towels.</p>
<h1>Paper Towels</h1>

<p>To make this model, I sketched two circles; both diameters came from a paper towel roll I measured in the classroom: 5.25 cm and 8.6 cm, respectively. Next, I made an extrusion, but I only selected the region between the two circles, leaving a 5.25-cm-wide hole in the center of the roll. This was much more straightforward than modelling a screw.</p>
<h1>Screw</h1>

<p>I sketched two circles: One for the top of the screw, and one for the cylindrical part of the screw. I extruded both of them. For the top, I picked 1 cm, although that was - in hindsight - too much. For the base, I estimated that the length was 4 cm. As for each circle's diameters, the caliper readings gave me 3.4 mm and 10.8 mm, respectively. Accouting for the coily pattern of the screw, the diameter rises to 4.9 mm. Making the coil was tricky, as I've never used that tool before. I kept getting errors about the radius of the coil being too small, and I had to make a new one after realizing that I needed 4.9 mm to be the diameter instead of applying an extra 1.5 mm to the 3.4-mm base. I didn't know how to exactly sharpen one end of the cylinder as if it was a pencil, so I used the fillet tool.</p>
<p>In addition, I had to move all 3 bodies together. For some reason, it took me several minutes of setting distances for each body to move, not to mention that I was also pressed for time. I had to keep orbiting the canvas so that each body lined up as best as possible.

<p>Here is the interactable model for the screw: </p>

<p>(I was not able to get each individual body's .dxf file. This is because models are .stl files.)</p>
