  ### Week 5: 3D Design and Printing

  This week, our class started working with 3D printers. We learned what to do with them, how to convert a Fusion 360 model to machine code that the printer can read, and various ambitious projects that can be made via 3D printing (such as a kinesthetic dress).
  
  Since I was still unsure on what to pick for my final project (Some of my main ideas are probably unfeasible.), I picked an object that can definitely only be made via 3D printing as opposed to a laser cutter or manually cutting wood or a similar material. For this week, I reused one of the models of my household objects, a screw.
  
  For Week 2, the screw looked pretty funky because the components of the screw model did not line up correctly, and the top of the screw was too tall. I fixed those issues in Fusion 360 and added a slit for a 4-point screwdriver to theoretically weave the screw into a hole.
  
  The model looks like this:

  I used a Prusa 3D printer to print my screw. The operation was high-risk because of the coil; a lot of support needed to be added, doubling the estimated print time. Many people doubted that the operation would work. This was the progression:

  Sadly, my classmates and teacher assistant were right: It was no easy task to disassemble the filmament that supported the screw when printing. I could not tell which part of the screw was extraneous support and which other parts were part of the screw's coil. Dismantling the supportive material with pliers was quite a messy job. In fact, I even snapped the very bottom accidentally! </div></p>
  
  I 3D printed a new screw with less support, thinking that I could get away with it, but the base part was practically nonexistent, and the whole screw was moving as new layers were being printed.
  
  The next step was to use a photogrammetry application (I used the classroom's scanner.) to scan another 3D object. I chose my miniature container of lotion. The scanner was very tricky to use, so the end result was a narrower version of the lotion bottle, and the scanner also picked up its surroundings. 
  This is the animated model:
