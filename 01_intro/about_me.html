<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi everyone! My name is Alan, and I'm a rising senior at Branford High School. 
I have been the captain of my school's <span style="color:#FF0000;">Math Team</span> since my junior year, and I will become the president of the <span style="color:#008000";>Physics Club</span> and the <span style="color:#008000";>Debate Club</span>. I am into video games, playing music, trivia, and science! 
I am currently enjoying the experience at Harvard Summer School; I like walking around campus with my friends, and being able to walk to wherever I need to be (instead of driving) is a neat perk of being in a college like Harvard.
I am excited to see what will unfold in the remaining Digital Fabrication courses!
