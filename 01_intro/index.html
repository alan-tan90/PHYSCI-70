  ### Week 1: Introduction 

  I have high hopes for this class. We're going to be experimenting around with 3D printers, laser cutters, and so much more!
  We meet on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 12 PM to 3 PM, and I have an extra lab period on Mondays and Wednesdays at the same time.
  
  I have a few ideas on what my final project is going to be, but I go with the flow, so my final project might be something totally different! 

  ![Idea of Night-Vision Glasses](./ProjectIdeas/glasses_sm.jpg "Glasses with flashlight attachments to allow seeing at night.")
  #### This is an idea of glasses with lights attached to allow seeing at night as if the wearer had a flashlight.
  ![Idea of a Trash Puncher](./ProjectIdeas/puncher_sm.jpg)
  #### This is an idea of a machine that punches trash in a trash can in order to compress it.
  ![Idea of a Food-Heating Knife](./ProjectIdeas/food_heater_sm.jpg)
  #### This is an idea of a knife that heats up food (such as meat) while slicing it. It's useful to keep your meal warm!
