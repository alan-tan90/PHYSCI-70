  ### Week 7: Electronic Output Devices

  We started learning about sensors and voltage dividers. For this assignment, we had to measure capacitence and other variables by using two sensors: A preexisting one and one we create. I opted to make a rotor sensor, using the rotor and Arduino code basis I had from week 3. I also used a thermistor, something I will need for my final project.
  
  # Thermistor
  
  I will need a heat sensor for my final project, so I thought this assignment would be good practice. I followed [this tutorial](https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/Marcazzan_M/how-easy-is-it-to-use-a-thermistor-e39321) to learn how to set the circuit and project up correctly. I had to calculate temperature via this formula:
  
  ![Formula](./assets/temperature_formula.jpg)
  
  Each variable is listed in the linked tutorial. The thermistor box that I got the thermistor from only said that it was an NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) with a resistance of 10 kilohms. No value of B was provided, so I had to use the one that the sample code provided. I used the classroom's magnetic thermometer to measure T0, which was 73 degrees Fahrenheit (295.928 Kelvin), and I used a multimeter to measure the resistance (10,040 ohms). For some reason, putting the thermistor and the resistor in the circuit causes their resistances to increase when measuring via a multimeter. There was another resistance variable that I needed to solve for. I simply calculated the current with "regular" total voltage and resistance values and used that to determine the in-circuit thermistor's resistance.

  I then used Arduino to collect temperature samples from the classroom, and output the temperatures on my computer at lightning speed. Afterwards, I collected the data for some statistics, as shown below. I used my TI-84+ CE to generate a graph.

      These were the minima and maxima.

      "L3" and "L4" were the two lists I used for my data sets when graphing the data.
	  "L3" has each temperature, and "L4" is the frequency list.

      This was the graph that my calculator generated.

  To change the temperature, I was stumped on what to do based off of the limited resources that the lab had. I decided to rub two pieces of wood together; the temperature that was detected obviously rose, but not by much. I also chose to only graph the temperature change in Fahrenheit.
  
  # Rotor Sensor
  
  A rotor sensor is basically, in my case, two spinning discs, each with part of a copper "sticker" attached to it, waiting for the two pieces of copper to align like a real capacitor. As said before, I used the motor that I had been using for the class so far, and some of the Arduino modules. I needed to laser-cut new discs (one cardboard and a few acryllic - the kerf for acryllic is so large!!!) and precisely cut a toothpick so that it would stick inside one of the holes of the spinning part of the motor. I needed the end of the toothpick to be 2 mm long, but the stick and the discs would keep falling off! The discs to latch on to the stick needed to have a 2.7-mm thick hole in their centers. Due to the kerfs being obscenely wide, I had to put masking tape on the stick to force the discs to stay in place by effectively slightly increasing the diameter.
  
  Here is a video of my rotor sensor in action:

  Once again, I used Arduino to collect data on the capacitence. The stats, minima, and maxima are all in this Google Sheet:
